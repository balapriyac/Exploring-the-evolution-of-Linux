# Exploring-the-evolution-of-Linux

This is a guided project from Datacamp.
Version control repositories like CVS, Subversion or Git store rich evolution information about a software project. 
In this project,the main tasks are to read in, clean up and visualize a real world Git repository dataset of the Linux kernel. 
With almost 700k commits and thousands of contributors, there are some data cleaning and wrangling tasks that help in gaining insights about the development activities over the past decade
